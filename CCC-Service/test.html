                    <p>Our goal is to provide quality prenatal care to all mothers. We are always accepting new patients, regardless of insurance status. At Covenant we offer Centering Pregnancy©.</p>
                    <p>Centering Pregnancy replaces traditional one-on-one visits with group visits and brings 8-12 women who are due at the same time, together for prenatal care. At each visit after health assessments are complete, the provider and support staff ‘circle-up’ with moms and support people.</p>
                    <p>They facilitate discussion and interactive activities designed to address important and timely health topics while leaving room to discuss what is important to the group. Centering materials help moms and providers ensure that everything from nutrition, common discomforts, stress management, labor and delivery, breastfeeding, and infant care are covered in group.</p>
                    <p>The Centering Pregnancy model has proven results: according to CHI 96% of women surveyed prefer receiving their prenatal care in a Centering group, 33% of women are less likely to have a preterm baby, and women are shown to have high rates of breast feeding.</p>
